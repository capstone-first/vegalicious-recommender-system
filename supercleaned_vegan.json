time: 25 min Start to finish: 30 min","1":"Wheat Free","2":"In this chutney-like compote, quince lends a ripe-pear creaminess, and pearl onions a lush sweetness, to tart cranberries.","3":"This recipe is used to prepare Cod Cannelloni with Swiss Chard and Roasted Peppers .","4":"This recipe is used to prepare Cod Cannelloni with Swiss Chard and Roasted Peppers .","5":"Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 45 min","6":"These vegetables would complement not only lamb chops but roast chicken as well.","7":"Breakfast bowls are the new green juice: they've become an in-demand menu item for the post-yoga, post-spin class set, despite some eyebrow raising prices for what boils down to a pretty simple breakfast. Why spend all of that money on something you can easily make at home? This hearty, gluten-free bowl takes just minutes to throw together and is absolutely delicious.","8":"Chef Kris Wessel of Florida Cookery in Miami Beach, Florida, shared this recipe as part of a Palm Tree Christmas menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. It showcases Florida oranges and grapefruits, which are at their peak during December.","9":"Great with chicken, turkey burgers or steak.","10":"Just as diced roasted red peppers add a distinctive vegetal sweetness to any dish they appear in, these, left in large chunks for maximum boldness, really complement the meat and its stuffing.","11":"Short-grain rice has an especially high starch content, which makes it sticky \u2014 and easy to press into a lettuce or nori wrapper.","12":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","13":"Celebrate the last of the hot weather with a spirited, chunky gazpacho in the Mexican mode. Tomatoes give the soup their characteristic rich, rounded flavor, and tomatillos\u2014an Aztec and Mayan staple\u2014lend fruity tartness and great body.","14":"Pastry chef Jennifer Jones of Topolobampo in Chicago shared this recipe as part of a Cinco de Mayo feature on Mexican desserts. Jones encourages you to use different fruits in this refreshing dessert, but recommends sticking to ones that are sweet but have acidity. Raspberries are a perfect example.","15":"This versatile condiment is a staple in Mexican kitchens and adds refreshing acidity to both the pinto beans and tacos.","16":"This beautifully simple, light curry is closely based on a wonderful recipe from chef Angela Hartnett. It's always preferable to use some carefully selected ground and whole spices in a recipe like this, but if you're in a hurry, use a ready-made curry powder instead of the dry spices.","17":"Carol Gilbert of Saratoga, California, writes: \"I've been working full-time since my daughter was in high school, but it took about ten years to get over the notion that I should be cooking everything \u2014 the way my mother did \u2014 and climb the corporate ladder. There's simply not enough time. I finally realized I didn't have to make everything from scratch; now I give myself permission to buy a dessert or a salad dressing if I need to.\"","18":"Boiling the vinegar concentrates and sweetens it, so the dressing doesn't require as much oil to balance the acid.","19":"As a harbinger of spring, artichokes have a special place on the Passover table and in our hearts. One of Roberts's favorite ways to enjoy them is this elegant Roman preparation. (Rome is home to the oldest Jewish community in the Western world\u0097the first Jews arrived in 161 b.c.e. as ambassadors from Judah Maccabee in Jerusalem.) The trimmed artichokes are braised in a lemony broth zinging with garlic and mint, which is later reduced to a satiny sauce.","20":"No Korean meal is complete without kimchi, a piquant condiment of fermented vegetables (most popularly cabbage) seasoned with ginger, garlic, chile, and all manner of fresh or preserved seafood. Fermenting the ingredients over several days gives the dish its distinctive tang, but this easy version, which takes advantage of the funky depth of Asian fish sauce, offers relatively instant gratification.","21":"Grilled Spring Onions","22":"This is the national condiment of both Argentina and Uruguay, and there are hundreds of versions. The sauce is also great with vegetables, especially grilled or fried tomatoes.","23":"The brittle is a great gift on its own.","24":"This weeknight falafel dinner brings the Middle Eastern platter home with a tangy, orange-spiked tahini sauce, bright quick-pickled red onions, and an easy green cabbage and tomato salad. Serve it with prepared hummus and pita for a more filling meal.","25":"(Spinaci con Pinoli e Passerine)","26":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","27":"This recipe originally accompanied bobotie.","28":"Thinly sliced garlic is simmered in olive oil until it is so tender that it nearly melts.","29":"Effort Level: II","30":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","31":"These hors d'oeuvres should be served warm, so fry a couple of batches at a time as platters need replenishing.","32":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","33":"Kumquats and cranberries turn out to be a perfect match, since their flavors are similar in intensity: The former contributes a pleasant citrusy bitterness to the latter's signature tartness.","34":"Coconut milk adds a silky richness to this South Indian\u2013style vegetarian meal.","35":"The black pepper adds a surprising aromatic and spicy flavor to the sweet grilled peaches. The recipe here makes more syrup than you'll likely need but it will keep in the refrigerator for at least 1 week and is great in a cocktail or with sparkling water.","36":"With some warm corn bread, this chili is a meal in itself. You wouldn't know there was chocolate in the recipe, but it adds a subtle depth of flavor to the dish.","37":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","38":"This spinach salad speaks to all the wonderful autumnal flavors of the Pacific Northwest. The new crop of bronzed Bosc pears is piled high at the farmers' market; the hazelnuts have been harvested, shelled, and bagged for sale; and the cranberries arrive from the Long Beach, Washington, coastal bogs. I buy sweetened dried cranberries from a local producer, but they are readily available at the grocery store (Ocean Spray is a good-quality packager), found alongside raisins and other dried fruits. This salad is a snap to assemble if you buy the packaged prewashed and trimmed baby spinach.","39":"\"As a confirmed New Englander, I was surprised to find a terrific seafood restaurant in Phoenix: Steamers Genuine,\" says Barbara J. Johnson of Worcester, Massachusetts. \"The baked halibut was perfectly complemented by roasted vegetables and potatoes au gratin. I know how to make the fish, but I wouldn't know where to start with the other two dishes.\"","40":"This is my version of harira, the national soup of Morocco, which shows up in unending variations from city to city, street stall to street stall, and family to family. It can be vegan, vegetarian, or made with meat\u2014usually lamb. Some cooks add chickpeas, chicken gizzards, or broken-up bits of angel hair pasta. But the result is always unmistakably harira, and that's what makes it so comforting and satisfying.","41":"Substituting rice vinegar (instead of cider or wine vinegar) produces a pickle that's less tart.","42":"Although several varieties of basil are used in Southeast Asia, the most common-called rau que in Vietnam and bai gaprow in Thailand-is generally referred to as Thai basil in Asian markets on this side of the Pacific. The leaves are slightly darker and narrower than the more familiar Italian basil and have purple stems and flowers. Rau que has a distinctively pungent anise flavor, but Italian basil is a perfectly acceptable substitute.","43":"If you make this whole recipe, you will have enough to feed a crowd, plus you will have half of a pineapple and perhaps half of a papaya left over. The salsa is especially good atop grilled chicken or fish.","44":"These herbaceous pickles combine spicy ginger with bright dill. Although cucumbers are classic, cherry tomatoes or green beans would also work well in this brine.","45":"Once roasted, the peppers are gently simmered with Sherry wine vinegar and garlic.","46":"The salad can remain at room temperature up to two hours before serving.","47":"Use to liven up Bloody Marys, or stir into sour cream as a sauce for roast beef.","48":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","49":"This sorbet has summer in every bite. Be sure to use very ripe apricots, and don't neglect the lemon juice. The sorbet is best eaten right after it is made.","50":"Note: To slice the onion and fennel in the following salad into paper-thin spirals, we used a Japanese rotary device known as the Benriner vegetable slicer.","51":"There will be more pecan pesto than you need for the beans, but it keeps well and can also be used on pasta, as a sandwich spread, or in potato salad.","52":"Sugar snap peas, cucumber, tomatoes, green onions, parsley and mint combine with orzo pasta for a lovely warm-weather salad.","53":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","54":"Do\u00f1a Tomasa and other Oaxacans often thin their guacamole with water to make a dipping sauce. Sometimes a little cream or milk is added as well.","55":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Charlie Trotter and Roxanne Klein's book, Raw.","56":"This recipe doubles easily.","57":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","58":"I get no greater satisfaction than knowing we've snuck some sweet potatoes and red cabbage onto the dessert menu at Vedge. This dish was originally inspired by a trip to the Czech Republic, where I enjoyed plum dumplings dusted in powdered sugar and served with vegan sour cream. Here, we fill our turnovers with candied whipped sweet potato, and the kraut garnish offers a nice bright note from the sweet Riesling. If you want to go all out, try serving them with a dollop of vegan sour cream whipped with a little powdered sugar and orange zest.","59":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Bruschette with Chickpea Pur\u00e9e and Chopped Arugula Salad .","60":"This relish has a smoky, savory quality, thanks to the chiles and garlic. Unlike most cranberry sauces, this one doesn\u0092t require any added liquid.","61":"These hot and sour pickles are great alongside the spread and frittata , and make a perfect garnish for the Bloody Beers .","62":"In order to be kosher when served with meat, the risotto in these cakes is dairy-free. It gets its creaminess exclusively from the starchy rice, so it's important to cook it slowly, stirring continuously, to release as much starch as possible.","63":"This meatless salad combines couscous with roasted eggplant, zucchini, red bell pepper and leeks. Cooked sausage may be added to make it heartier. Serve with rolls or baguette slices and iced tea or white wine.","64":"Choose beets and potatoes of about the same size.","65":"Fiery habaneros impart brightness to a rich pork dish like Yucatecan-style pork.","66":"(COMPOSTA DI CILIEGE E ALBICOCCHE)","67":"The radicchio delivers nice color, but endive or escarole hearts would be smart substitutions flavorwise.","68":"A hearty combination of textures and flavors.","69":"Improv: Skip the maple syrup and chopped ginger and add a couple of teaspoons of fresh lime juice.","70":"This fruit butter makes a quick dessert. It's also a great snack on bread or toast. We use it in a low-fat recipe for a moist and chunky apple butter spice cake. We have found preserving in half-pint (250 mL) jars convenient, since that recipe calls for that amount of apple butter. But if you use larger jars, you'll have lots left for other uses.","71":"Kale and radicchio both do quite well on the grill; the direct heat turns their edges charred and crispy while the inner leaves become tender and stay intact. Soaking the kale is important so that steam can build and cook through the tough stalks as the leaves grill. Because kale and radicchio are both slightly bitter greens, they take to a sauerkraut-style dressing just as well as cabbage does.","72":"Crunch-crunch-crunch will end up as munch-munch-munch when this salad is served. Flavor is obviously crucial in food, and certainly this salad has flavor, but tactile sensation is also a very important factor in our food perception and appreciation. We want pasta al dente, celery crunchy, bread grilled. This salad has a lot of texture to enjoy.","73":"Opening a can of tomato paste just to use a tablespoon or two for a recipe can be something of a drain on one's culinary resources\u2014do you ever remember to use the rest of the can? This recipe is the delicious solution. Leftover tomato paste (from our Sausage\u2013Stuffed Potatoes with Green Salad) gets pur\u00e9ed with roasted red peppers, walnuts, and garlic to become a luscious, deeply flavored spread. This easy recipe makes a lot, so it's perfect for a party. And it's so good that it's even worth cracking open a fresh can (it will taste just fine if you use the whole thing).","74":"If you're trying to incorporate more dark leafy greens into your meals, Swiss chard is a great starter vegetable. It cooks quickly compared to kale and collards, and the stems are as delicious as the leaves. In fact, the stems are the prized portion of the plant in Provence, and that's not something kale or collards can brag about.","75":"Almost any berry, or combination of berries, can be substituted in this recipe.","76":"Japanese eggplants are smaller, sweeter, and faster-cooking than other types. If using globe eggplants, slice them into half-inch rounds.","77":"In this vibrant green dish, the bitterness of broccoli rabe comes in second place to the sweetness of the peas and the comforting familiarity of olive oil and garlic.","78":"Muoi Tieu Chanh","79":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","80":"Everyone's favorite Polish dumpling. Toothsome, warm, soft, and smothered in caramelized onions\u2014yep, that's the stuff! In NYC, pierogi are a brunch staple.

You can use whatever quantities of mustard and dandelion greens and spinach you happen to have on hand\u2014just keep the total amount of greens the same.","289":"If you don't have a rice cooker, this is the way to prepare absolutely perfect rice. The liquid cooks down before you cover the pot, so you have more control over how much liquid evaporates; this makes all the difference between mushy and fluffy rice.","290":"A dash of curry powder transforms this cool fruit soup into a sweetly savory first course.","291":"Cooking by color might not be the surest way to devise holiday-appropriate recipes, but who can resist the lure of black linguine on Halloween? Tossing it with pumpkin-hued vegetables lusty with garlic and hot pepper might seem like hobgoblin overkill, except that the flavors work well together. Really well. So much so that you'll be making this pasta combination again and again, long after the jack-o-lanterns have disappeared.","292":"A colorful combination of oranges, berries and kiwis teams up with crunchy biscotti for a delicious and wholesome finale.","293":"Roast these up to four hours ahead; put them in to reheat when the prime rib is done.","294":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","295":"This black bean spread gets a hint of unexpected sweetness from the ground fennel seeds. Traditional Mexican dishes often use dried avocado leaf, which has a similar flavor. Try the spread as a base for tostadas or nachos, or serve with chips for dipping.","296":"Packed with healthy superfoods and a little caffeine kick from matcha powder, this creamy green smoothie bowl makes a satisfying breakfast. Chia seeds and oats add density and fiber, while mango and fresh ginger add sweetness and spice.","297":"China meets the Southwest in this unusual fusion salad. Glistening Chinese black rice\u2014usually sold under the label Forbidden Black Rice\u2014set off against bright orange segments and avocado's pale green gives the mixture striking visual appeal.","298":"A combination of brown rice flour, almond flour, and arrowroot replaces wheat flour in these delicious gluten-free muffins. The flavors of orange, coconut, and almond blend nicely here, with maple syrup adding a subtle back note of sweetness. Serve these for breakfast, brunch, or an afternoon snack.","299":"Chop the shallots and the garlic in the processor to make this recipe even easier.","300":"Start off a holiday meal in the freshest way possible: With crunchy radishes dipped in olive oil and then into flavorful herbed salt.","301":"Brandi Neuwirth of Cary, North Carolina, writes: \"My family and I moved here from Los Angeles last year, and my new surroundings have really influenced my cooking. There's a great farmers' market nearby where I get lots of local ingredients. The produce there inspired me to create this dish, which is a real taste of the South.\"","302":"This version of pasta e ceci (pasta with chickpeas) thickens the sauce with pur\u00e9ed chickpeas, and it's finished with a fresh garlic-and-rosemary oil, which adds great flavor and an even better aroma.","303":"A vegetarian twist on a Chinese take-out standard, these sprouts deliver crunch, spice, and zing.","304":"The popular side makes a great toast topper.","305":"This dish is the vegetable incarnation of mulled wine\u2014the cabbage and onions soak up all the flavor of the red wine and spices, becoming incredibly aromatic.","306":"Cranberries make a traditional breakfast spread festive and seasonal.","307":"Feel free to create your own mesclun mix. We suggest baby red oakleaf, baby arugula, m\u00e2che, and bite-size pieces of Belgian endive, fris\u00e9e, and radicchio.","308":"This recipe originally accompanied Mushroom and Thyme Risotto Cakes with Roasted Tomato and Arugula Salad . If you're not keeping kosher or serving this salad with meat, you could top it with crumbled blue cheese.","309":"A versatile alternative to couscous, this is a summer starch that doesn't have to be served warm. If you have fresh or cooked leftover vegetables in the kitchen, toss them in to make a main-course salad. You can also play with the herbs to suit the dishes this will accompany.","310":"Editor's note: This recipe is adapted from Gabrielle Carbone, coproprietor of The Bent Spoon ice cream parlor in Princeton, New Jersey.","311":"Pack carrot and celery sticks along with this lemony hummus.","312":"The bright flavors are a nice counterpoint to rich foods.","313":"We decided to use sweetened flaked coconut rather than fresh coconut for this recipe because it not only saves time but enhances the overall flavor of the dish, adding a touch of subtle sweetness. Soaking the basmati rice strengthens the grains to prevent the rice from breaking down during cooking.","314":"The olives can marinate before starting the stew, which cooks in just over 30 minutes.","315":"Blood oranges have red flesh and sweet-tart juice. They're available at farmers' markets and, increasingly, at supermarkets. This syrup would also be good over waffles.","316":"Matt Wallace, bartender at Harvard & Stone in Los Angeles, created this potent fruit-filled punch for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. The combination of pineapple, orange, and lemon plus the crisp, dry bubbles from the Champagne really wake up your palate after a long winter, he says. The citrus and sugar base is called oleo-saccharum, and is common in older punch recipes. Wallace says it's an excellent way to add a subtle citrusy perfume to the final drink, and requires time but very little labor.","317":"For extra eye appeal, use tricolor pasta in this fresh-from-the-garden salad.","318":"EFFORT: NOT MUCH\nPREP TIME: 15 MINUTES\nCOOK TIME: 6 HOURS\nKEEPS ON WARM: 1 HOUR","319":"Couscous is one of the fastest side dishes to prepare, but this jazzed-up, garlicky rendition shows that it need not be bland. Serve it with the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Paillards or with grilled Italian sausages.","320":"The intense raspberry flavor of this jam makes it a longtime favorite. Warming the sugar beforehand keeps the jam boiling evenly and ensures success.","321":"Nowhere are vegetables as important as they are in Sicily, and few vegetables are as popular-or have as long a history-as the eggplant. There are said to be hundreds of ways to prepare it. Peppers and artichokes are almost as well loved and common. A country cook often gets produce from a small kitchen garden called an \"urtu\".","322":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","323":"I grew up on green beans thoren, and while I'll never tire of its crunchy deliciousness, I think adding corn makes it even better. And even though people don't often associate stir-fries with Indian cooking, this dish is a favorite in Kerala. It's a combination of diced vegetables and coconut, but the key is moistening the coconut so it can soak up the ground spices first. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.","324":"This recipe was created to accompany Seared Rosemary Scallops .","325":"Saffron rice is an indispensable accompaniment in Persian cuisine, and it tastes just as good made with fluffy quinoa. Crushing and steeping the saffron in hot water brings out its full flavor and color. If you have coconut oil on hand, the naturally sweet flavor pairs nicely with the cherries and almonds.","326":"Boiling away the butter and seasonings from the leftover vegetables allows the flavors of the marinade to shine through. (If you don't have any leftover veggies, simply steam a mix of your favorites.)","327":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","328":"This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America.

Cameron of Washington, D.C..\"The granola at breakfast is terrific. I would be grateful if you could get the recipe from their chef so that I can surprise my husband by making the granola at home.\"","332":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","333":"I made a beet ravioli dish for the restaurant menu when we first opened, and it remained popular for quite some time. Our regulars weren't at all happy when we finally took it off the menu. On special occasions, such as Valentine's Day, we've brought back variations on that beet ravioli, sometimes using cookie cutters for hearts or other sweet shapes. If you can find them, candy-striped beets are beautiful and unique, or try using golden beets, or even a combination of all three.","334":"This dish originally accompanied Steamed Scallion-Ginger Fish Fillets with Bok Choy .","335":"For the best flavor, use very ripe tomatoes and don't refrigerate the sauce. Toss it with pasta, spoon it onto baguette slices, or use it as a topping for grilled chicken, seafood, or tri-tip.","336":"Vibrant greens, handfuls of fresh herbs, nuts for crunch, and horseradish for bite. Ingredients are suggestions; feel free to mix it up.","337":"Don't bother peeling the onions; their skins add a nice, rich brown color to this vegetable stock. If you'd like, remove the skins for use in dishes when a lighter color is preferred, such as in risotto or cream sauces.","338":"This recipe was created to accompany Gumbo Z'herbes with Red Beans , Shrimp, Crab, and Oyster Gumbo , Chicken, Sausage, and Okra Gumbo , and Beef Fil\u00e9 Gumbo .","339":"A favorite of Nancy's son.","340":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","341":"A salad this simple requires the finest ingredients to make it shine.","342":"Broccoli needn't only be cooked fast until bright green and al dente. In fact the flavor is amplified when it's braised slowly until as tender as can be. You can enjoy this as a vegetable side dish, spoon it over garlic-rubbed bruschetta, or toss it with pasta and freshly grated pecorino or Parmesan cheese.","343":"Active time: 25 min Start to finish: 25 min","344":"This \"salsa\" is actually a sort of fruit salad, but it does contain the quintessential salsa ingredients, lime juice and jalape\u00f1o peppers. The jalape\u00f1os are certainly unexpected, but they have an interesting way of intensifying the sweetness of the pineapple.","345":"We like to whip up this delicious tofu scramble with home fries made from Yukon Gold and sweet potatoes on lazy weekend mornings. Begin to cook the scramble just as the home fries are nearly browned to perfection so you can serve this hearty and soul\u2014satisfying breakfast all at once. It tastes and looks great when accompanied by salsa or chopped tomatoes and a handful of garden\u2014fresh herbs.","346":"Although this is a chilled beverage, it is traditionally enjoyed in the winter. The \"fire\" of the cinnamon and ginger is supposed to warm you up, while the coolness of the beverage balances the heat. Not being much of a traditionalist, I like to make it during the summer and keep pitchers of it available as an alternative to iced tea.","347":"Blasting cauliflower florets in a hot oven concentrates their natural sweetness, turning them into something akin to vegetable candy.","348":"Steaming unlocks the succulence of okra. Here, the pods are tossed with slivered ginger and a Vietnamese-inspired scallion oil in an all-purpose dish that's great with grilled steak or chicken, or with nothing more than a fragrant bowlful of jasmine rice.","349":"Slightly underripe plums? Add a touch more honey.","350":"Wheat Free","351":"Cashews lend body, creaminess, and richness to this pea soup and also make it vegan; sub almonds if you prefer.","352":"There are many packaged side dishes on the market, but we particularly like curried couscous. Here, it becomes a main course. Serve with: Warm flatbread and spinach salad with citrus vinaigrette.","353":"This eye-catching fruit m\u00e9lange also includes kiwi, which isn't tropical but is very colorful and refreshing. Using store-bought sorbet makes this even easier to prepare.","354":"Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 1 1\/4 hr","355":"This textural celebration of legumes includes those that are both in and out of pods. You'll find crisp-tender Romano beans and green beans, as well as droves of firm yet creamy fava beans (also called broad beans), which have been a staple in places like Egypt, China, and the Mediterranean for millennia. The beans are all cooked in one pot and then warmed in a skillet, where verdant shreds of basil join them at the last minute for extra oomph. Sound easy? That's because it is.","356":"We've been making chef Scott Howard's ginger syrup in bulk and keeping it in the fridge for quick tonics and late- evening cocktails. If you have a juicer at home, by all means use it, but good store-bought 100 percent carrot juice will work just as well here.","357":"Golden fried shallot rings make this garlicky bok choy stand out.","358":"Fresh, peppery arugula pairs nicely with the Steamed Clams with Pasta.","359":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Warm Peach Shortcakes with Bourbon-Brown Sugar Cream.","360":"Using a salad spinner makes short work of washing fresh spinach, which usually requires several changes of water. Start by filling the spinner bowl with water. Then fill the basket with spinach, submerge it in the water, and stir the spinach to release dirt. Lift the basket out and repeat with fresh water.","361":"Of all the rich and succulent winter squash varieties, delicata, with its long and uniformly narrow shape, is the easiest to work with. And its thin, pale-golden skin with green striations is more than just pretty \u2014 it's edible, too.","362":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Ted Allen's The Food You Want to Eat. For Allen's tips on throwing a Thanksgiving party, click here.","363":"This inventive salad is a terrific addition to any summer buffet. For this party, also prepare red cabbage coleslaw, or buy some at the market or a take-out spot.","364":"It's hard to imagine anything better than freshly picked ears of corn roasting to golden-brown goodness on the grill. One taste of our Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce and you'll be wondering why you ever stuck to plain ol' butter. This sweet and tangy sauce transforms the season's staple produce into a standout, flame-kissed favorite.","365":"A V-slicer or mandoline is the perfect tool for thinly slicing the fennel. The fresh apricots add a nice sweetness to the salad, but feel free to skip them if they're not available in your area.","366":"Editor's note: Use this gluten-free flour mixture to make Jeanne Sauvages' Spritz Cookies or Sufganiyot (Jelly Doughnuts).","367":"Soundtrack: \"Hot Lava\" by Kudu from Death of the Party","368":"Roasting turns broccoli into an addictive side. This crowd-pleaser can be prepared in no time.","369":"It may seem odd that we use frozen green peas, but, sadly, even the best fresh ones can taste starchy by the time they make it to the supermarket.","370":"A typical Israeli breakfast selection would include this salad (either already prepared or with the vegetables available), the pita bread, and Za'atar along with fresh goat's \u2014 or cow's \u2014 milk cheeses, yogurt, hummus, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and avocados (in season).","371":"Ginger and garlic give these pea pods a hint of Asian flavor, but we think they're a good all-purpose side dish.","372":"Beautifully bright green, this herbaceous oil really enhances the anise flavor in the lobster gel\u00e9es.","373":"This gorgeous winter salad would go well with the Mediterranean Supper Omelet. The seasoned rice vinegar takes candied walnuts from ubiquitous to inspired.","374":"Fresh figs are a wealth of life force, containing thousands of tiny seeds that make them a very virile and hormone-rich food. These delicate fruits are very popular in the cuisines of Europe and the Middle East, where they originated. Feel free to use any sprouted nut in the preparation of the nut kreme; pecans are my favorite.","375":"Try this delicious variation on the traditional vanilla-and-espresso dessert.","376":"Serve these succulent eggplants with the steamed red snapper .","377":"Use the grating disk of a food processor to grate the beets more easily.","378":"This classic uncooked relish gets an aromatic edge from cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.","379":"Elumichampazha Sadam","380":"The perfect quick-fix dinner for chillier nights when you want something warming but don't have much time to cook\u2014the combination of feel-good greens and creamy coconut is a real winner.","381":"\"Strawberries and Sambuca are such a wonderful combination,\" says author Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez. \"Add a little vanilla in there and you can't go wrong. And it's beautiful, too.\" We totally agree.","382":"These sweet ribbons are the perfect way to turn carrot cupcakes into edible presents.","383":"After you finish pickling the strawberries, hang on to the brine, which can be used in place of mild vinegars.","384":"Regular oranges work just as well, but they won't impart the same fiery sunset color.","385":"This recipe originally accompanied Passover Chocolate Torte with Raspberry Sauce .","386":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Chocolate Chestnut Torte with Chocolate Cognac Mousse.","387":"In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).","388":"This recipe includes a little citrusy butter melted over the vegetable once they are out of the oven. If you're feeding kids, though, remember that they sometimes prefer their roasted vegetables plain. When carrots or other roots are at their best, that's how I like them, too.","389":"Let's just dive in, shall we? Not only does this produce a thick and creamy vanilla frosting, it also doubles as a whipped topping, and left unrefrigerated it becomes a vanilla sauce to serve with crumbs, shortcakes, or volcanoes. And why stop there? I especially love the sauce on savory bites like corn bread, muffins, and biscuits, where it acts like a decadent sweet butter. If you try to steer clear of soy, replace the liquid and powdered soy with the rice milk variety for both in equal measure\u2014but be advised that the result will taste slightly sweeter. Please note: If it's true frosting you want, be sure to factor in the full six hours for it to chill and set.","390":"These falafels can be prepared as crusts for use in the Middle Eastern Plate, or they can be made into more traditional falafel balls. To make these balls, just follow the instructions below but roll the mixture into 1-inch balls, then dehydrate them for only 8 to 10 hours.","391":"The honey is optional because some carrots are sweeter than others. Taste the salad, then decide whether to drizzle.","392":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.","393":"A frosty glass of refreshing iced tea is the inspiration for this sorbet. Iced tea flavored with peaches has nearly outpaced tea with lemon in recent years. Bottles of tasty peach tea are available in most stores, but you can also brew your own with peach tea bags. If you use bottled tea in this recipe, make sure it isn't diet.","394":"Tostones","395":"Gently pickling the shallots mellows them and also adds hints of sweetness and acidity. Tossing them with some earthy, quick-cooked kale makes for a pleasing contrast in flavors.","396":"Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Joanne Chang's Breakfast Pizzas .","397":"Improv: Replace the mushrooms with diced firm tofu and\/or wilted spinach.","398":"Nourish your body with this welcoming salad complete with a warming ginger dressing. Lentils provide a fabulous source of protein and the beet adds that splash of color I love so much.","399":"This recipe originally accompanied Gingerbread with Dried Fig, Apricot and Cherry compote","400":"Accompanies Alambre de Camarones, Alambres de Camarones.","401":"These spicy pickles pack a mean punch. Toss them into salads for a sharp bite or use them as a fun garnish on your weekend Bloody Marys. This brine is also great with green beans or asparagus.","402":"Pressing excess moisture out of your tofu will increase its firmness and its ability to absorb the flavors of the marinade.","403":"Like the striped pops from the ice cream truck\u2014without the artificial flavors and colors.","404":"This is a high-summer throw together of a saut\u00e9 to make when there are lots of snap beans at the market. Mix colors and types for the full effect.","405":"Improv: Instead of water chestnuts, try sugar snap peas or toasted walnuts.","406":"Beguni","407":"Haroseth\u0097a thick condiment of fruit, nuts, and wine\u0097symbolizes the mortar the Israelites used in Egypt. Roberts\u0092s particular mix of almonds, pistachios, dates, and dried apricots, reflective of the Middle East, is outstanding (note that we prefer the sweet-tart complexity of California\/Pacific apricots to the bland sweetness of Turkish ones). Enjoy leftover haroseth slathered on matzos or crackers; we discovered it\u0092s great with Manchego cheese as well.","408":"Stir some chopped fresh mint into yogurt for a cool topping on sliced tomato and cucumber salad, with warm pita bread alongside. Pistachio ice cream on sweetened orange segments is perfect afterward.","409":"This robust, vibrant-color juice is packed with big flavors and energy-boosting nutrients to get you going in the morning.","410":"Chestnuts are a big industry in the Languedoc; the region provides most of the French supply of the chestnut confection marrons glac\u00e9s.","411":"It's common in Oaxaca to add mint to rice, adding a subtle herbal dimension.","412":"Active time: 25 min Start to finish: 4 hr","413":"What is a country salad? In my mind it is a thoughtful blend of greens \u2014 Lola Rosa, fris\u00e9e, red oak leaf, tatsoi, endive, m\u00e2che, arugula, and mizuna \u2014 combining different tastes and textures, topped with a ripe cheese and an artisanal cured ham, and garnished with seasonal fruit and vegetables. A well-balanced vinaigrette and spiced walnuts make it impossible to resist.","414":"Be sure to start this recipe at least 1 1\/2 hours ahead so the components have time to cool. Mix up the syrup and chill it until it's cold. Cut the melons into wedges and refrigerate them in plastic containers. Then, just before you leave, chop the mint and stir it into the syrup, then drizzle the syrup over the fruit.","415":"These potatoes steam away in the coals while you grill the rest of your meal. If you're not eating them right away, keep them in their foil pouches and rewarm them on the grill or in a 350\u00b0F oven before serving.","416":"Scoring the plums helps the poaching liquid infuse the fruit all the way to the pit.","417":"A warm, richly spiced oil turns a bowl of mixed olives into elegant party fare.","418":"Toasted seeds and nuts add bite to this nutrition-packed salad. We use dried sprouted legumes, which are even more healthful than ordinary beans and more convenient than sprouting your own. (Cooked lentils and mung beans work well, too.) A vibrant chive vinaigrette brings it all together.","419":"Tomatoes are great for grilling. The searing heat caramelizes the tomato's natural sugars. Tomatoes readily absorb the flavors of herbs and other seasonings, and their shocking red color looks terrific on a plate along with grilled poultry, seafood, or beef. The tomatoes can be grilled on any sort of indoor grill\u2014for that matter, you could also smoke them in a stove-top smoker.","420":"Mixing visually striking black barley with raw and cooked vegetables creates lots of flavors and textures. Feel free to substitute the more readily available pearl barley instead.","421":"Tart and fiery, this classic bright-green salsa shows off the flavor of tomatillos and the lovable grassy sharpness of fresh unripe chiles. Serve it with anything that would benefit from lively contrast, such as Chopped Fried-Fish Tacos .","422":"Our food editors find the texture of pineapple sherbet so much lighter and fluffier than that of other sherbets and sorbets \u2014 it practically has the weightlessness of granita. It provides a wonderful, tangy balance to the rich ambrosia cake and is delicious on its own, too.","423":"You don't have to feel guilty about giving these to the kids\u2014 they're made with real fruit syrup and are bursting with sweet berry flavor.","424":"This is probably the most famous lentil dish coming out of India\u2014yellow lentils tempered with spices and the usual holy trinity of garlic, ginger and chile. It has always been a favorite of mine and it would grace our family dinner table at least once a week when I was growing up. There are lots of different recipes for flavoring the oil (tadka), so play around with your spice pantry and see what you come up with. If you don\u2019t have half of these spices, then don\u2019t worry; just add a tablespoon of your favorite spice paste and it will taste just as delicious.","425":"This would be nice with any roasted meat.","426":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","427":"Tumis Sayur","428":"Benefits: Heart + Metabolism","429":"Brandi Neuwirth of Cary, North Carolina, writes: \"My family and I moved here from Los Angeles last year, and my new surroundings have really influenced my cooking.

It also makes a lovely light dessert on its own.","432":"Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 20 min","433":"Drummed up by our intrepid recipe tester Lauren Godfrey, this nontraditional taco, sweet with squash, earthy and nutty with kale, and crunchy with fried pumpkin seeds (pepitas), is\u2014shhhhh\u2014vegan. Don't tell anyone, but because it is so tasty, no one will care. The cashew crema can be replaced by store-bought crema or our Cumin-lime crema, but after polling both vegetarian and carnivorous friends, everyone preferred the nutty and rich nondairy cashew version (which must be made with raw cashews to work). To prepare the butternut squash, use a sharp peeler to remove the tough skin before slicing it in half and scooping out the seeds and fibers. Lazy cook's tip: Some markets sell butternut squash already peeled and seeded and ready to go.","434":"Blanched almonds go into a blender with water and oil and come out as a luscious aioli. Because the nuts aren't toasted, the sauce doesn't actually taste very nutty. It's more decadent than yogurt, more subtle than mayo.","435":"Marinating and searing the watermelon concentrates its flavor and primes it for this savory treatment.","436":"If you can only find regular coconut milk, buy 2 cans and use the thick cream that's floating at the top. The coconut cream will caramelize during cooking, leaving sweet brown flecks in the rice.","437":"At Selamat Pagi, our Balinese restaurant, lime, ginger, and lemongrass are mainstay ingredients, appearing in many dishes. We were thinking about making a sorbet that reflected some of these ingredients and wondered what would happen if we threw all of them together. Our initial taste transported us back to the lush green hills of Bali, after which we were all too disappointed to find ourselves standing in our test kitchen. Along with lemon sorbet, this might be our go-to refreshment when we desperately need to cool off.","438":"If your grill is already fired up, why not give it a quick brushing and throw dessert on there, too? A balanced tropical marinade brings depth to caramelized pineapple.","439":"This recipe originally accompanied epi:recipeLink=\"101031\"Thai Curry Penne with Ginger-Tomato Chutney<\/epi:recipeLink>.","440":"This recipe originally accompanied epi:recipeLink=\"101037\"Buttermilk Pancakes with Blueberry Compote<\/epi:recipeLink>.","441":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Peach Baked Alaskas with Spiced Peaches and Raspberries.","442":"Over the last few years I have started to love zucchini, but I have to admit that by the end of the season, it's like, \"Not another bloody zucchini!\" That said, this is one of the joys of eating seasonally\u2014anticipation and excitement at the start of the season, despair and overload at the end.","443":"Haroseth, a symbolic seder food, alludes to the mortar that the Jews used to build the pyramids when enslaved by the Egyptian pharaoh. Though haroseth visually mimes the unappealing look of cement, its taste is actually a delicious combination of fresh or dried fruit, nuts, spices and wine. There are as many variations of haroseth as there are seder tables around the world, and all reflect a myriad of traditions. This recipe is inspired by my grandmother's simple grated apple, walnut, and cinnamon version, along with the flavors of my husband's Middle Eastern background.","444":"You can practically live on this salad in sultry weather. It tastes bright and fresh and is satisfying without being heavy.","445":"A lovely array of textures and flavors. Very nice with skewers of grilled scallops or panfried salmon fillets.","446":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","447":"Active time: 10 min Start to finish: 35 min","448":"Great with basmati rice","449":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.","450":"This juicy, crunchy salad-on-toast gets even more texture (and flavor) thanks to quickly fried capers and basil.","451":"Coating the toasted pita in olive oil prevents it from getting soggy when mixed with the vegetables and dressing.","452":"Roasted eggplant spreads and salads come in many variations throughout Greece and are usually embellished with local flavor. In the North, yogurt is often added to the eggplants, for example, throughout the Cyclades, it is the ubiquitous caper and tomato that season this delicious dish.","453":"Try this for breakfast or as a side dish.","454":"Offer the salad with grilled steaks and some bread for mopping up the juices.","455":"For a heartier dish, add sliced grilled steak or chicken. Hoisin sauce can be found in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.","456":"Coleslaw on the grill? Absolutely. It makes the cabbage and green onions tender and adds just a bit of smoky flavor.","457":"Like most Francophiles, when we are not traveling to French-speaking (and -eating) destinations, we are at home, dreaming of them and inspired by them as we cook the foods we love. Steak frites is the definitive French bistro dish; our portobello version features a juicy red wine reduction that sings with tarragon and a touch of Dijon. You can easily make restaurant-crisp fries at home with the Vedge method: start with baked potatoes, then crisp them up in a little oil.","458":"This creamy-crispy take on mashed potatoes, similar to a giant latke, is ideal for a dinner party because it can be assembled ahead.","459":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","460":"This crackers recipe features a variety of seeds, and the combination of colors and textures is impressive, but you can use fewer types\u2014just make sure total volume stays the same.","461":"Store-bought sorbet with a special sauce combines with <epi: recipeLink=\"101753\">Lemon Butter Cookies<\/epi:recipeLink> for a refreshing, sweet and tart treat.","462":"Once you've charred them, you can drizzle these eggplants with your best extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with some coarse salt for a simple side. But they're even better paired with one of the three luscious sauces (Yogurt and Sumac Sauce , Smoky Tomato Sauce , or Lemon-Mint Sauce ) and some grilled flatbread or pita.","463":"Many dessert menus include a colorful sorbet plate-light and refreshing after a rich meal. Offer elegant cookies alongside. For the pink grapefruit sorbet recipe, we prefer Essencia, a dessert wine with the unique flavor of orange muscat grapes. It's made by Quady Vineyards in central California. If you cannot find it, use a Sauternes or a late-harvest Riesling.","464":"Use this for the Springtime Sushi Nests or for any sushi recipe.","465":"A whole head of roasted garlic lays the foundation for an eggplant spread that's silky and satisfying, while chopped sun-dried tomatoes, fresh parsley, basil, and lemon add a healthy dose of sunshine, brightening its flavor and color. Serve it with thin slices of toasted baguette for a great take on crostini.","466":"Spooning this conserve over yogurt makes a light, sweet summer dessert.","467":"This rice is delicious with Amber's Pineapple and Cardamom Chicken with Mint, but would also be great alongside curried shrimp or grilled lamb chops.","468":"Editor's note: Chef Donald Link of New Orleans restaurants Cochon and Herbsaint, shared this recipe as part of a special Mardi Gras celebration he created for Epicurious. Use the spice mix to make his Link Family Crawfish Boil.","469":"While the restaurant serves the ultra-spicy salsa alongside hummus, tsatsiki, and baba ghanouj, chef Eric Leyden suggests it as a lively accompaniment to meats and hearty lentil or tomato soups.","470":"Juicy, crunchy cucumbers lighten the starch in a rice salad, and lemony coriander accentuates the citrus in the vinaigrette. So-called Persian cukes seem especially beautiful against a background of exotic purple jasmine rice. This is a party dish for which, no doubt, you will become justly famous.","471":"I adore lychee juice, which tastes very much like the fresh fruit. You can buy aseptic packages of the juice in Asian markets, and I've seen them in many supermarkets. This sorbet is not only delicious, it's fun.","472":"Mint brings a hit of freshness to this classic side.","473":"Editor's note: Use this salsa to make Deborah Schneider's Mushroom, Rajas, and Corn Taco with Queso Fresco .","474":"This vinaigrette is delicious as is, though it can serve as a base as well. Add minced shallot or garlic, minced fresh herbs, lemon zest and juice, cracked black pepper. Use it with grated carrots or beets, fresh tomatoes, or any other vegetable mixture.","475":"One of the reasons I go giddy about springtime is artichokes, particularly the small ones with tips closed tightly, like a flower at night. Some home cooks are reluctant to fill their totes with artichokes, as they'll need to be turned\u2014the barbed leaves plucked off and the other inedible bits trimmed away. I quite like the process. It's meditative and satisfying once you get the hang of it. In this dish, the fleshy artichokes get browned and crispy tops and look like strange, beautiful roses. The acidity in the white wine cuts through the rich, dense veg and, along with the salty pops from the capers, highlights the artichokes' unique herbaceousness.","476":"This sweet-savory condiment is delicious with roasted or grilled meats.","477":"Chips and dip: classic, and every culture has its take. There's hummus and pita, tortilla chips and guac, British chips and tartar sauce... From time to time, we\u2019ll run an Indian take on chips and dip using crunchy papadums (thin and crispy lentil crackers) with a cold, creamy version of dal (stewed beans and lentils). The trick is to keep the dal super light so it doesn\u2019t snap the papadums.","478":"This recipe originally accompanied Jalape\u00f1o Popper Fritters with Tomato Salsa .","479":"A far cry from the crisp-tender green beans of recent fashion, this is a classic example of the popular Ottoman-era dishes called zeytinagli, in which vegetables are cooked for a long time in olive oil, then served at room temperature so that the flavors are at their peak.","480":"Watching frozen bananas and peanut butter blend into ice cream seems like magic; pull out this trick at your next dinner party. Adding grape jelly makes it irresistible to kids and adults.","481":"Local island vegetables are used in this colorful dish offered at Jake's in Jamaica. Serve with brown rice or as a side dish with fish or chicken.","482":"An aromatic syrup that calls to mind the clean smell of the forest enhances the flavor of fresh blueberries. Also, since it's poured over the berries while hot, it colors them a gorgeous sapphire and softens them, making their burst in the mouth even more intense.","483":"Skewering and grilling whole garlic cloves gives this vibrant sauce its smoky sweetness. Make the salsa as chunky or as smooth as you like.","484":"Pea shoots are the young, tender tips and vines of the snow pea or the sugar snap pea plant. Once your plants are established and producing an abundance of pods, clip off leaf and tendril sections about 4 inches (10 cm) long. If you don't have your own plants, look for these tender shoots at farmers' markets or Asian grocery stores. Sambal oelek (or ulek) is an Indonesian chile paste, and tart, citrusy kaffir lime leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking. Look for both products in Asian markets.","485":"Toasting the seeds and nuts in oil forms the base of a complex vinaigrette for simple roasted vegetables.","486":"The faint sweetness and low acidity of balsamic vinegar is a perfect foil for the earthy taste of beets. For the recipe, there's no need to invest in an expensive real balsamic vinegar (labeled \"tradizionale\"); a decent mass-produced commercial brand works just fine. Baking, rather than boiling, the beets brings out their robust flavor.","487":"An Asian treatment of chestnuts that will be right at home with all your side dishes.","488":"Fennel and raisins are a classic combination, and they come together here with rice to make a gratifying side dish. Dried fennel seeds help boost the fresh vegetable's delicate anise flavor, while plump golden raisins thread the rice with sweetness.","489":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","490":"Juicy Asian pear and a balsamic reduction play against the bitter edge of fris\u00e9e\u2014further mellowed by leeks hot from the pan.","491":"Who knew that dessert could be as easy\u2014and refreshing\u2014as combining sugar and water?","492":"Crisp beans are paired with sour onions and a sweet maple dressing.","493":"Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 45 min (includes cooling onion)","494":"A classic Moroccan tagine (or stew) is typically made with meat.

My children are the opposite \u2014 they like 'American' food. But I haven't given up trying to make Indian meals that the whole family will like. This recipe pleases everyone.\"","496":"I admit that I'm hard on sugar snap peas. I get disappointed when they suck, of course, but I also get grumpy when they're anything less than perfect\u2014unblemished, super sweet, and not a bit starchy. That's the curse of keeping high standards, I suppose: you're so rarely satisfied. When at last I do find perfect snap peas, I make this salad. I leave them raw\u2014only the finest snap peas can be this delightful without a dunk in boiling water\u2014and accentuate their flavor with little more than a lemony dressing and mint. If you'd like, you could add some creamy goat cheese in blobs or good old burrata alongside.","497":"Fresh ginger and yellow mustard seeds make these sweet potatoes much more worldly than their candied incarnations. The cilantro takes them in an unexpected but very welcome direction.","498":"A quick-to-make vinaigrette that's great tossed with greens and poured over steamed vegetables or orange slices. Present it in an antique glass cruet.","499":"Zanne Stewart, Gourmet's executive food editor, originally developed these carrot sticks to take on a picnic, but they were such a hit they've become a staple in her refrigerator.

This dish is also delicious served with pork.","503":"Use any combination of ripe melons that you can find. Charentais (or Cavaillon), delicious French melons with orange flesh, are at farmers' markets now, while Galia (sweet and aromatic, similar to honeydew) and Sharlyn (a white-fleshed variety that tastes like a combination of honeydew and cantaloupe) are increasingly available at supermarkets.","504":"Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 20 min","505":"This is a standard Ashkenazi (Eastern European) recipe, with a little brown sugar added for depth.","506":"Watermelon and yogurt may sound like unlikely bedfellows, but this refreshing dish deliciously disproves that assumption.

Make sure each layer is completely frozen before adding the next, as it looks great when the layers are really well defined.","514":"Jasper Soffer, bartender at the Mulberry Project in New York City, created this simple-to-prepare seasonal cocktail for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. The rhubarb simple syrup, Soffer explains, is simultaneously sweet and tart, not unlike a rhubarb-apple crumble or a strawberry-rhubarb pie. If you want to make this drink outside rhubarb's short early-spring season, frozen fruit makes a great substitute.","515":"For snacking, try this tropical topper with Hawaiian lavash crackers, or serve over grilled chicken.","516":"Port and orange juice accent this cranberry and dried fig sauce.","517":"This creamy, garlicky tahini sauce also pairs wonderfully with lamb. Serve it as a dipping sauce, or as a spread on cold lamb sandwiches.","518":"Golden raisins add a bright sweetness to this fresh take on sweet-and-sour pickles.

Here, I've panfried it to crisp the edges and draped it in a velvety Vietnamese-style caramel sauce. A shower of fresh herbs and browned shallots gives it an extra layer of flavor. If you prep the herbs and make the sauce ahead, you can put this on the table in under half an hour.","522":"The nutty, slightly spicy flavor of the sweet red wine works well with the berries in this dish.","523":"Harissa is typically made with hot chiles and served with couscous. This herb-based spin is great with roasted vegetables, or as a rub for fish.","524":"Often called kosher-style dill pickles, these are quick to make. Use either small whole cucumbers or cut larger ones into quarters. For an additional interesting flavor, tuck a small dried hot red pepper into each jar.","525":"Lime is an integral part of great guacamole\u2014or so we thought.

They are also delicious with scones or muffins at teatime.","533":"When I was growing up, my mom would cut up fresh fruit and arrange it on a plate with a shot glass full of toothpicks. She would also toss fresh fruit with some orange or lime juice and sugar. Taking inspiration from her, I came up with my own version: lime, lemon, a little maple syrup, and an herb syrup with rosemary or mint.\nCut your fruit into chunks rather than into small pieces; I find that small pieces of fruit get mealy and mushy. Make the salad the morning you're going to serve it, but if you're determined to make it the night before, cut up the fruit, store it in separate containers, and then toss it together in the morning. Use whatever fruit you'd like (bananas, apples, berries\u2014the possibilities are endless), but unless you're using the ripest, sweetest seasonal fruit, add a little sugar.","534":"Crispy calcium bites by Janine Doran, chef at Cafe Flora in Seattle.","535":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Kimberly Kennedy's The Art and Craft of Entertaining.","536":"This rich gravy gives a boost of extra flavor to vegetable broth thanks to an earthy thyme-garlic oil and umani-rich cremni mushrooms.

The accompaniments are an essential and fun part of the dish, adding some fresh crunch to the toothsome bite of hominy, beans, and vegetables. It's the perfect meal to have waiting on the back of the stove for family and friends as they straggle in from near and far for a holiday weekend.","538":"Few desserts scream summer as much as these ice-cold pops on a scorching day. Lime juice adds a tart, refreshing twist to this classic fruit treat on a stick.","539":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional sitting time.","540":"Salty, crunchy bites, tasting of the sea, complement the lobster gel\u00e9es' delicate, melting texture.","541":"This recipe was created to accompany Cold Poached Chicken with Ginger Scallion Oil .","542":"Turkish cooking might sound exotic, but it's easy. Most of the ingredients are familiar, and combining them in new ways makes for an exciting and different way to eat. This is an excellent side salad for lamb chops.

It's delicious with pork but is especially tasty on bread with cream cheese.\"","545":"Vietnamese-style rolls are a great addition to your summer repertoire: They require very little cooking and can be assembled at the kitchen table or out on the patio.

Most cooked cranberry sauces should also work, so feel free to experiment.","557":"These cinnamon buns are well worth the extra effort to make. They're so moist, sticky, cinnamon-y, and delicious you'll never miss those sugar-laden ones sold at malls. P.S.

We have been known to ship these appetizers to friends and customers on the West Coast who have called in need of a fix. These seitan skewers are wonderful when well charred and served with refreshing Chimichurri Citrus-\u00adHerb Sauce. They freeze very well and are great to have on hand to serve as appetizers, snacks, or an entr\u00e9e.","566":"Fagiolini in Umido","567":"If blood oranges are unavailable, simply use the sweetest oranges you can find.","568":"The garlic-nut sauce known as tarator, which sometimes also includes tahini, is a classic Turkish accompaniment to mussels and fried fish as well as vegetables. Here, it's used with cauliflower that is sliced \u2014 rather than separated into florets \u2014 so that it can be more easily browned, which gives it a nutty flavor that complements the tarator perfectly.","569":"Adrak aur Kari-Patta Rasam","570":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","571":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","572":"If you're planning to use the leftovers to make the fried rice with pork and kale , reserve 3\/4 cup of this saut\u00e9ed kale.","573":"Dried chipotle chiles become smoky-hot packages for a filling made from subtly sweet ripe plantains.

Add a spoonful to a glass of club soda, sparkling water, or iced tea for a refreshing summer drink.","581":"Chef Hugo Bolanos of Los Angeles' Hotel Bel-Air shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. His turmeric-infused green juice features apples, celery, kale, and parsley but it's a flexible recipe, so feel free to experiment with different veggie combinations. Bolanos recommends swapping in Japanese cucumber for the celery, and substituting Swiss chard for the kale.","582":"Lightly frying the zucchini for this dish is the only step that takes a bit of time.

It is an integral ingredient in Sicilian cuisine, and the variety of recipes featuring it \u2014 the most famous being caponata \u2014 is astounding.

Serve it as a side for grilled vegetables or meats or hearty stews like Easy Lamb Tagine with Pomegranate.","598":"The peppers can be roasted and the broccoli blanched a day ahead, leaving just the saut\u00e9ing to do before serving. This dish is equally delicious served right off the stove or at room temperature.","599":"This lovely side can be made a day ahead.","600":"Begin marinating the olives at least two and up to five days ahead.","601":"Roasted potatoes are good and all, but a roasted root vegetable medley is just as easy to make and a little bit fancy too.

While the veggies are roasting, toss a garlic bulb or two into the pan at about the 30-minute mark\u2014the result: easy, creamy garlic! Yum.","602":"Coconut milk is a staple in Thai cooking, but you don't have to limit it to Asian food; it's a great resource for making anything super yummy and creamy.

It follows that if you want pickles with real snap, don't process them at all. These dill-pickle spears\u2014or sandwich chips, depending on how you slice them\u2014can be processed, if you want, for long-term shelf storage, but first try making a batch to keep in the refrigerator. They will be crisp, and the flavor of raw cucumber comes through. It's the freshest-tasting pickle in this book, and perhaps my favorite. The recipe can be scaled up.","606":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","607":"Mediterranean Herbs cilantro and mint add a fresh note to this cranberry sauce.

This is my all-time favorite sorbet.","611":"Roasting cauliflower with spices brings out the very best in this vegetable\u2014the golden, crispy florets are irresistible. Like broccoli, cauliflower contains compounds that may help fight damaging toxins.","612":"P> The secret to properly cooked Chinese-style rice, whether white or brown, is to first rinse the rice and then to avoid cooking it in too much water. For fried rice, the rice should be cooked until just tender to the bite.","613":"No ice cream maker is needed to make this flavorful sorbet.","614":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","615":"Roasting brings out fennel's sweet side.","616":"Chap Chae","617":"Veal in Switzerland often presupposes sauerkraut, but we prefer a lighter take.

And then I had actual children. I'm no parenting expert, but my personal studies have shown that anytime you can legitimately make a meal out of a cookie and milk, you're golden. As it happens, grown-ups won't turn these down, either. And, bonus! When made with flax \"eggs\" and gluten-free oats, these wholesome gems are vegan and gluten-free.","632":"Parcooking in vinegar water helps set the starches so the potatoes get crisp, rather than floury, when roasted.","633":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","634":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Vanilla Mousse Meringues and Fresh Berries.","635":"Cooked dried chickpeas are firmer and more flavorful than canned.","636":"You may add 1\/4 cup of lemon juice to this jam, right at the end, to give it a tart edge that sets off the flavor of the strawberries.","637":"Fresh corn from a farmers' market or a grower's farmstand will taste the sweetest.","638":"Colorful, refreshing and delicious.","639":"Prized by gardeners during the Renaissance, celery root, or celeriac, has a light celery flavor and a dense flesh that is perfect for shredding into slaws. This salad is wonderful with the chicken and biscuits or the flank steak.

Chiles add smoky heat.","649":"This indispensable condiment adds tangy crunch and a bright pink note to your tacos.","650":"\"When it comes to cranberry sauce, I'm no fan of the back-of-the-bag recipe: It's too sweet and offers little in the way of texture. That's why I've made this raw, tangy, refreshing relish ever since I started hosting Thanksgiving. It's my new classic.\" \u2014Andrew Knowlton, restaurant and drinks editor","651":"In this unusual pairing, the string beans and baby arugula work wonders for each other. Wilting the arugula with the hot, garlicky grilled beans is a nice trick for bringing the two together. While you can use regular arugula if you must, baby arugula is far milder in flavor, so try to find it if you can.","652":"This salad, crunchy with red pepper and fennel, pairs well with the broiled trout or with grilled lamb or chicken.","653":"Avocado, Belgian endive and spinach are combined with oranges and radishes in this gorgeous seasonal salad.","654":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","655":"Chickpeas loaded with warming, aromatic spices become a hearty vegetarian dinner when served with rice, cucumber salad, and a dollop of thick, cool yogurt. They're also great alongside roast chicken.","656":"Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 20 min","657":"Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 30 min","658":"Ten Chi Kaki Ag\u00e9","659":"Berries are such a great source of nutrients called polyphenols, which make them and the foods\nthey are mixed with a lovely slow energy releaser, perfect to avoid those unwanted energy\nhighs and then lows after eating refined sugar. These tarts are wonderful for when you are\nentertaining guests and need an easy and cool-looking dessert.","660":"Leftover onions are great in a classic Martini.","661":"The crisp Rosemary Toasts taste great dunked into this flavorful soup. To serve on the side, toss arugula with sliced red onions and basalmic vinaigrette, then top the salad with shavings of Parmesan cheese. For dessert, keep it simple with ripe pears and amaretti (almond cookies).","662":"A coarse texture is absolutely key; if the chickpeas are too finely chopped, the falafel will be dense.","663":"This recipe was created to accompany Moroccan Lamb and Quince Stew.","664":"This marmalade would also be delicious with roast Cornish game hens. If the sweet Maui onions aren't available, substitute Vidalia.","665":"Poached frozen peaches eat like fruit-shaped sorbet and look like a three-dimensional sunset.","666":"(Chickpeas Cooked in a Spicy Tomato Sauce)","667":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","668":"This is my Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon salad. The two main ingredients\u2014carrot and avocado\u2014might not seem compatible or connected, but your first bite will convince you otherwise. The carrots are roasted with cumin and paired with orange, both classic pairings for the vegetable. The citrus goes great with cilantro, and both are a fine match for avocado. Before you know it, you have this fresh, vibrant salad. I love the carrots roasted to the same creamy softness of avocado. The contrast comes not from the texture but from the fact that one's warm from the oven and the other's cool from the fridge.\nSorry if I got your hopes up, but despite the salad's nickname, there's no bacon.","669":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","670":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","671":"The sweet potato and coconut milk balance the spiciness of this dish. Serve it over white rice, and dinner is ready.","672":"This is a gem from my mother's notebook of Nonna Mary's recipes. I remember Nonna Mary serving these tomatoes along with assorted grilled meats during the summer in Cesenatico. They are also a perfect accompaniment to veal cutlets, and together they make a great sandwich, one of my favorite lunches that my mother would pack for me to take to school.","673":"Lane Crowther, Bon App\u00e9tit contributing editor, says, \"When I was young, the potatoes on the holiday table were always mashed. Even today, my mother, who is still in charge of our Thanksgiving dinners, will rarely stray from tradition. Either there has to be a trade-off to get her to try something new, or\u2014as in the case of this recipe\u2014innovation simply comes as an addition to the menu, not a replacement. Well, with so many different kinds of potatoes available nowadays, I like to mix varieties for their contrasting flavors, textures and colors. This combination of red potatoes and Yukon Gold is an easy-to-make and great-tasting accompaniment to any meal.\"","674":"Cooking anything very gently in oil produces a deliciously moist result (duck confit, for example), and this is no exception. The soft, tangled ribbons of carrot and fennel turn velvety and are balanced by slivers of lemon zest and the warm spark of cayenne.","675":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","676":"Lightly garlicky and herbed, Moroccan-inspired carrots are versatile enough to accompany almost any meal.","677":"The earthy flavor of the beet is balanced by sweet raisins, spicy ginger, and sweet-spicy red onion. After Thanksgiving, serve this chutney with lamb.","678":"Beer-Can Chicken, step aside. Cabbage becomes the star of any backyard barbecue with this awesome beer-steaming-plus-grilling technique. It's a smoky, sweet vegetarian play on pulled pork for Beer-Can Cabbage Sandwiches, but the chopped cabbage can also be served as a side dish.","679":"The easy tomato chutney is adapted from Madhur Jaffrey's cookbook From Curries to Kebabs. Make the chutney and combine it with the green beans about four hours before serving, which allows plenty of time for the beans to soak up the flavors.","680":"This broth, the backbone of many of our soup recipes and an ingredient in many others, was developed with brain health in mind. It includes onions, fennel, parsley, oregano, and rosemary, all of which contain antioxidants, as well as parsnips, which are a good source of folic acid. The recipe uses water as liquid, but you can start with chicken stock or fish stock to make an especially flavorful broth that would be great for sipping on its own.","681":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","682":"Coarsely chopped coriander seeds add a lovely floral note to this nutty Middle Eastern grain.","683":"This recipe is part of the Epicurious Online Cooking School, in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America. To watch it being made, and to learn how to make other Mexican classics, check out the videos.","684":"Cranberries might seem out of place in a salsa, but their zesty crunch anchors this mix of roasted pineapple, onion, and cilantro. Besides, what would Thanksgiving be without cranberries?","685":"A texture riot of a salad; it gets crunch and creaminess from toasted pecans and almond butter(!).","686":"Charring the vegetables adds bittersweet depth; serve leftovers on scrambled eggs.","687":"My biggest challenge to date has been making cupcakes for a six-year-old's birthday party. This recipe, the result of many trials and taste My biggest challenge to date has been making cupcakes for a six-year-old\u0092s birthday party. This recipe, the result of many trials and taste tests, was a huge hit with the kids, who are always our toughest fans. Packed with coconut for electrolytes, lemon juice for vitamin C, and bananas for potassium, these little gems keep us feeling great.","688":"Juicy pineapple with a nip of rum and ginger is a sophisticated compote that complements bites of the pecan spice cake (recipe precedes) but also makes a satisfying light dessert on its own.","689":"Like it or not, cucumbers and radishes have become virtually seasonless. Here, they provide a lively, refreshing counterpoint to the meal's overall richness. What's more, the whole dish can be put together in mere minutes.","690":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","691":"Rich in protein, essential fatty acids and fiber, chia seeds are harvested from Salvia hispanica, a herbaceous plant native to central Mexico that was as an important food source of the Mayans and Aztecs.","692":"A salad from your pantry and fridge: Canned and frozen beans are the secret behind this attractive mix that includes crunchy celery and earthy cumin.","693":"This slightly unusual side dish takes the place of your standard green beans, lending a light and crunchy contrast to the heavier, pur\u00e9ed dishes in this menu. (Most people don't think of cooking jicama, but we love its crisp water-chestnut-like texture, raw or saut\u00e9ed.)","694":"The lemon juice gives these potatoes an appealing fresh taste.","695":"To make these ice pops nonalcoholic, substitute freshly squeezed orange juice for the tequila.","696":"South Indian rice is parboiled during processing, which creates a more nutritious but harder grain that needs to be boiled like pasta for 40 minutes. The grains are puffy and separate, and they absorb the curries beautifully. Indian parboiled rice can be ordered from iShopIndian.com; but if this type is not available, American-style converted rice or regular long-grain white rice are both good substitutes. (North Indian basmati rice would not be served at a Sadhya.) This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.","697":"Juicy pineapple meets creamy avocado, crisp jicama, and red onion in a refreshing salad that goes especially well with the cilantro-chipotle tilapia .","698":"Throw everything in the pan, and voil\u00e0! Cranberry sauce. It\u0092s just five ingredients simmering on the stove, but it tastes beguilingly complex. Tangerine juice and zest, fresh ginger, and plump golden raisins add a citrusy, spicy sweetness to tart, bursting cranberries.","699":"Try this cinnamon-scented sauce over vanilla ice cream, pound cake or both.","700":"This dip was inspired by a recipe for bissara, a garlicky pur\u00e9e from Egypt made from dried broad beans, in Claudia Roden's Mediterranean Cookery.","701":"For a richer version, add a little olive oil.","702":"This was inspired by a dish created by Alex Padilla, sous chef at Boulevard, the San Francisco restaurant owned by Aidells's wife.","703":"Susan O'Brien (adapted by Lori Sobelson)","704":"Green beans cooked crisp-tender retain their vivid color and snap, bringing garden freshness to the table no matter what the season. In this quick Asian-inspired side dish, toasted sesame seeds\u2014 along with a dose of sesameoil\u2014:add an aromatic, nutty touch.","705":"If you're making the striped bass in agrodolce sauce as well as this salad, save 1\/3 cup chopped fennel fronds for garnishing the fish.","706":"Don\u2019t skip on the fresh herb garnishes for this recipe; they will serve as a good contrast to the curry.","707":"This lovely side dish is delicious with roast pork or chicken, or grilled sausages or fish.","708":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","709":"The leftover Savoy cabbage from our <epi:recipelink id=\"351167\"\">Winter Minestrone<\/epi:recipelink> makes a quick and easy side dish when thinly sliced and saut\u00e9ed with some scallions and garlic. It tastes great with pork chops, chicken, or fish.","710":"Reflecting the cuisines of Israel and the surrounding Mediterranean Middle Eastern countries, this meatless stew is seasoned with mint and lemon. Serve it with sesame seed rolls and a tomato and cucumber salad; have pistachio ice cream for dessert.","711":"Preserved lemons, sold ready-made in Moroccan souks, are essential to that country's cuisine. The peel, pulp, and juice squeezed from the lemons can all be used. Sometimes, however, the juice and preserving brine, can be bitter; use fresh lemon juice in that case.","712":"Jeanne Thiel Kelley, a contributing editor at Bon App\u00e9tit, says, \"As far back as I can remember, my father has been glazing the holiday ham with Marsala (we always have ham and turkey on Thanksgiving). When I started making the cranberry sauce, I decided to mix in a little Marsala, figuring that the combination would complement the ham nicely. I was right, and the sauce is terrific with turkey, too. Rosemary might seem like an unusual seasoning in this sauce, but for me it's a natural addition. I live in Southern California, and fresh rosemary is just everywhere.\"","713":"An easy stovetop method that is quicker than a rice cooker and yields tender, distinct grains that cling gently to each other? Read on.","714":"Long-grain rice won't do the trick here; short- and medium-grain have the perfect texture for the clay-pot chicken, not quite absorbing the sauce but supporting it in a delicious way.","715":"Chervil's delicate anise flavor enhances the season's baby vegetables. If you don't have chervil, substitute fresh dill.","716":"This is such a sweet little dessert. As you know, I\u2019m not one for sweet treats but this is a little pop of yumminess\u2014perfect for dinner parties, and it won\u2019t leave your guests rolling around on the floor with indigestion.","717":"We typically think of pickling as involving mainly vinegar or, as is the case with kimchi, a fermenting process. In India, however, oil is the secret ingredient, employed to carry the flavor of spices. Here, mustard seeds and ground turmeric bring brightness to the mix.","718":"This is especially good with grilled fish.","719":"This power-breakfast smoothie will be extra smooth if you soak the nuts and oats in water overnight; drain before proceeding.","720":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Crescent Dragonwagon's book Passionate Vegetarian. Dragonwagon also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.","721":"Instead of the usual approach of topping dandelion greens with hot bacon dressing, here we tame the greens' bitter bite with a Spanish-inspired dressing flavored with almonds, raisins, and Sherry.","722":"This recipe originally accompanied Lemon-Almond Buttermilk Loaf with Balsamic Strawberries .","723":"In India, lentil-based dals are often served as a side dish, but adding a host of vibrant vegetables turns this into a main course. Brightened with turmeric and infused with garlic, ginger, and spices, the red lentils are cooked down into a creamy pur\u00e9e. Best of all, the flavor improves with time, so make it ahead for a night when you need a quick supper.","724":"This dish is a welcome departure from run-of-the-mill sides. Lemon zest and golden garlic give wilted arugula and tender green beans multidimensional flavor.","725":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Vanilla-Citrus Tea Ring . Any remaining compote would be great for breakfast or dessert with a spoonful of yogurt or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.","726":"Sugar cookies are the perfect accompaniment to this colorful finale.","727":"This vegetarian gravy is layered with bold flavors \u2014 from the onions to the roasted mushrooms and barley \u2014 each of which makes a real statement. Even our carnivorous food editors agree it's one of the best gravies they've ever tasted.","728":"The classic dessert goes tropical in this luscious rendition featuring pineapple and coconut.","729":"Steve Silverman of South Burlington, Vermont, writes: \"In my cooking I tend to be very quick and health-conscious. During the summer, my wife, Mary, and I usually grill chicken or fish and make salads. I'll use whatever fresh vegetables and ingredients I have on hand and come up with a wonderful meal for the two of us.\"","730":"Just three ingredients make a fresh and bright uncooked relish\u2014and the colors are beautiful, too.","731":"Warm spices and sweet dried fruit are a perfect pair for rich turkey meat.","732":"Cranberries are transformed with sweet, subtly earthy dried figs and velvety, slightly spicy Pinot Noir into a chunky, jamlike chutney. Orange zest infuses the mix with its bright citrus flavor and essential oils. Ginger works well in both savory and sweet preparations, and its touch of heat bridges the wine and fruit here. You can serve this chutney instead of the standard cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving, but it is also wonderful with pork and venison dishes, spread on a sandwich, or as an accompaniment to a cheese plate.","733":"Not overly sweet, and with a spunky kick, this palate cleanser is a take on the traditional Italian combination of strawberries, black pepper, and balsamic vinegar. (It also tastes great in a Bloody Mary.)","734":"If you're using a commercial cold-brew maker like a Toddy, follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing and filtering. Feel free to play around with how you dilute this\u2014you might prefer a stronger or weaker coffee than the one suggested here. And coffee-heads the world over agree: cold-brew is only as good as the beans it's made with.","735":"This simple side dish can be served warm or at room temperature. To make sure the eggplant is not undercooked, keep an eye on the grill and move the eggplant around as needed.","736":"Gina: This colorful salad is one of my go-to recipes when I need something to satisfy a crowd, whether at a church potluck supper or a backyard barbecue. The champagne vinaigrette gives the beans a fresh, zippy flavor. For the best results, add the fresh beans to the salad just before serving, so they do not discolor.","737":"In July, the abundance of ripe tomatoes means making your own tomato juice is a breeze, and fresh juice, in turn, means a truly superb Bloody Mary. With a range in the amounts of horseradish, Tabasco, and lemon juice, you can customize the drinks to your liking. The final flourish, rimming the glasses with sea salt and black pepper, adds a slight tingle to each sip.","738":"Southern cooks use their chile-infused vinegar to add a tart, floral kick to dishes like chicken or greens. You can also use it to wake up salad dressings. Customize it by adding bourbon or fruit liqueur and using your favorite chiles.","739":"Massaging the greens both softens and seasons them before grilling.","740":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","741":"This recipe is part of a menu developed for Epicurious by Charles Phan, the chef-owner of San Francisco's The Slanted Door. Read more about Phan and Vietnamese food.","742":"Cups of this calming grain tea, extolled for its digestive properties, are poured throughout Korean meals as Westerners would provide water. In the winter, the tea is usually served hot, while in the summer months, it comes cool or at room temperature.","743":"Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 45 min","744":"This recipe is a component of <epi:recieplink id=\"109335\">Baked Figs with Honey and Whiskey Ice-Cream<\/epi:recieplink>.","745":"Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Ted Allen's The Food You Want to Eat. For Allen's tips on throwing a Thanksgiving party, click here.","746":"What you find here and on page 96\u2014aside from a striking striped presentation\u2014is an equally beautiful expression of flavors. Because both beets and pears are at the height of their season, Lee has no desire, as he says, \"to mess with them too much.\" He adds, \"Nature trumps the ability of any chef.\" The ginger juice in the vinaigrette is inspired by Lee's Asian roots.","747":"Toasted pistachios, apricots, cinnamon and allspice bring great flavor to this accompaniment for the chicken.","748":"This all-purpose, all-season stock recipe works perfectly in any Vedge recipe. This will store for up to five days in the refrigerator. You don't need to peel any of the vegetables; just wash them carefully.","749":"This clever caramel sauce is made from coconut milk instead of the usual condensed milk.","750":"Frozen peas are a gift to the breakaway cook: their creamy, earthy goodness bursts with flavor, and they couldn\u2019t be easier to store and prepare. The pesto-like tarragon emulsion, made even creamier by the addition of Greek yogurt, really brings out the best in them, and the sprinkling of pistachios on top lends a lovely toasted, nutty texture. Try them with a broiled fish fillet and a glass of grassy Sauvignon Blanc.","751":"This recipe comes exclusively to Epicurious from Suzanne Tracht of Los Angeles' Jar restaurant and is part of a modern Hanukkah menu.","752":"Beer makes for a particularly crisp batter here, and the capers add piquancy. The broccoli and carrots work well in this recipe, but cooks might use other favorite vegetables too, adjusting the deep-frying time as necessary.","753":"Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 1 3\/4 hr (includes chilling time for syrup)","754":"Be sure to sample \"forest greens\" if you find them on a menu in Copenhagen\u2014this term is not just a flight of fancy. The greens on offer there are pristine wild lettuces, herbs, and grasses growing in the mountains and on the forest floor. Since most of us don't have the opportunity to forage forest greens, we made this salad with a tangle of microgreens, which work nicely. The vinaigrette nods to the Scandinavian love for curry, but it truly plays up the flavors of the pork and potatoes as well, so feel free to drizzle it all over the plate.","755":"Try this alongside a chicken cutlet, on a turkey sandwich, or thrown into a stir-fry.","756":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","757":"These wine-infused, ring-shaped biscuits, called taralli, are on every Pugliese table during the antipasto course, but good ones can be hard to find in the U.S. This homemade version replicates their crisp, crumbly texture, with occasional hits of black pepper.","758":"Passion fruit nectar adds a tropical twist to this traditional brunch cocktail.","759":"Carciofi alla Romana","760":"Rice pilaf can be made traditionally, with basmati rice, or with regular long-grain white rice. For a real treat, garnish the pilaf with shredded coconut, raisins and chopped green onions.","761":"Rosemary and peppercorns in the bouquet garni give an unexpected kick to this chilled dessert, which is elegant on its own or spooned over vanilla ice cream or yogurt.","762":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","763":"Ajwain wali Poori","764":"Chef Ashley Christensen serves this jam with cheese and thinly sliced country ham or prosciutto as a sweet-and-salty starter.","765":"We were surprised at how many different varieties of gorgeous red lettuces and red greens we were able to find to create this visually stunning salad. Tossed with a simple vinaigrette, it is a lovely counterpoint to the richness of the meat and potatoes.","766":"Why do I love roast winter vegetables? For starters, because they are fresh, local, and seasonal. Unlike summer produce, they keep for a long time without losing most of their flavor. They feel like winter food: hearty, substantial, rib-sticking. Francis Mallmann quick-roasts them at very high heat in a wood oven until they almost burn. A home oven doesn't put out that kind of thousand-degree heat, but when something as simple as slices of Delicata squash are coated with a little bit of olive oil, sprinkled with kosher or coarse sea salt, and then roasted, they come out of the oven chewy, nutty, sweet, and savory. Part caramelization, part umami, and part Maillard.","767":"Majorcans love to talk about the quality of their vegetables, and this dish of saut\u00e9d eggplant, potatoes and bell peppers in fresh tomato sauce, called tumbet, is one of their favorite creations. We suggest serving it with grilled fish or lamb chops, as Majorcans do.","768":"The trick to french fries is double-frying. First, flash-fry the potatoes to eliminate moisture, then fry them again to ensure crispness. Eating them with mayonnaise will take you to Europe.","769":"This sauce, inspired by Spanish romesco, uses cherry tomatoes, which are usually the best-tasting type in the market this time of year.","770":"Street vendors throughout Mexico's beach towns sell cold fresh fruit served in a plastic bag with bits of ice in it to keep the fruit chilled. This dessert is as take on that, as well as a refreshing end to any meal. Feel free to experiment by pouring a bit of tequila over the ice to create an instant margarita.","771":"No Thanksgiving dinner would be complete without cranberry relish. It can be made in large batches if you want to make enough for the winter.","772":"Rettichsalat","773":"McFadden always dresses his salads with the acidic components first so the produce can absorb some of those flavors before being coated with oil.","774":"Michael Lindley, Public House, Chattanooga: \"Cucumbers are great in picnic food, something you can take with you anywhere.\"","775":"Serve with jicama sticks, radish slices, peeled cooked shrimp, and corn tortilla chips.","776":"This one-dish wonder grants you immunity from even the most gluten-averse, meat-abstaining, fat-conscious houseguests. And the spicy vegetarian curry tastes as good as ever reheated.","777":"Orange juice and pomegranate juice enhance the light sorbet. The compote would also be good over store-bought strawberry sorbet or ice cream.","778":"Watercress is the green of choice in Cuba, its peppery taste a perfect foil for the avocado and the sweet pineapple in this classic Cuban salad. I serve it with shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce called enchilado de camarones. In Cuba, the pineapple is never roasted, but this technique adds another dimension of flavor I find very appealing.","779":"This spin on onigiri, Japanese sticky white rice balls, combines the earthiness of brown rice and mushrooms with the crunch of a sesame seed crust. The key is cooking the rice until it releases all of its starch, then chilling it in the fridge so you can easily roll it into balls before baking.","780":"\"My husband and I just returned from a trip to Italy,\" writes Kim Riemann of North Brunswick, New Jersey. \"Of all the great meals we had there, a few stand out in my memory. One was at Buca Mario in Florence. The rosemary-scented bean soup was unforgettable.\"","781":"Unlike their big brothers, baby artichokes are almost completely edible and require minimal preparation. For this first course, saut\u00e9ing the artichokes instead of steaming adds good flavor. Some people don't like to have artichokes with wine because they can make the wine taste either metallic or strangely sweet. In Italy, though, artichokes and wine are usually served together. A crisp, steely Pinot Grigio does the trick.","782":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","783":"Light, refreshing and very sophisticated. Asian pears have a crisp texture, a round shape, and a sweet and floral aroma that's quite unlike that of the more familiar buttery \"pear-shaped\" pear.","784":"Pick firm, bright-green celery stalks with lots of leaves.","785":"When I was a single gal in NYC and my parents lived in Westchester, we used to meet almost halfway for dinner at Gus's in Harrison, new york. It is a great bar serving delicious seafood and their salad was my favorite\u2014red wine vinaigrette with big hunks of blue cheese. We were always a blue cheese\u2014loving family and my version, with a creamy base (can't compete with Gus!), is fantastic on a wedge of iceberg lettuce or as a dip. It lasts for a good week in the fridge as well.","786":"Editor's note: This recipe is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by Chris Miller, executive chef at Como Shambhala Estate at Begawan Giri in Bali.","787":"Crusty bread and radicchio with creamy Italian dressing make nice sides. End with red grapes and anise-dusted sugar cookies.","788":"If it's melon season, you have to make this. In Burma (Myanmar), gin thoke, meaning \"ginger mix,\" is a blend of crispy fried garlic, sesame seeds, and ginger, and is eaten as a sweet digestive snack after meals. Although not native to the region, melons are a refreshing and delicious complement to this dressing, together making a perfect summertime side dish. The ginger is key to this salad. Ideally, the gingerroot should be so young that the skin is almost transparent and the roots are tipped with pink.","789":"Try these anywhere you'd use pickled onion, such as in grain bowls, on roasted carrots, or on a cheese sandwich.","790":"This recipe was created to accompany Red Snapper Papillotes with Lemon and Thyme .","791":"This recipe is an adaptation of the wonderful smash of vegetable served on the sliced-pork sandwiches at Philadelphia's Tony Lukes. Liberated from the bread, the dish has a slight bitterness that makes a great foil for the richness of Broiled Duck Breasts with Orange Chipotle Sauce .","792":"Yukari shiso salt is powdered dried purple shiso leaves mixed with salt, a tangy and colorful seasoning. It's often available in Japanese markets, but if you have trouble finding it, substitute another flavored Japanese salt like matcha salt (green tea salt) or furikake, seasoning for rice that comes in many varieties.","793":"A passover meal wouldn't be complete without haroseth, a traditional, chutney-like condiment.","794":"Start this at least one day before serving.","795":"Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 40 min","796":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.","797":"Flaming desserts-like this one and crepes suzette-were all the rage at fine dining establishments in the sixties. The title here refers to the sweet cherries, dried cherries and cherry juice-enhanced by vanilla bean and orange peel-that provide such terrific flavor.","798":"The kitchen was the domain of Miraglia Eriquez's grandmother, but this recipe was her grandfather's specialty. Sitting at the dining table, Poppy, as he was known, would peel and cut oranges, toss the pieces into glasses, and cover them with red wine. After the oranges soaked up and sweetened the wine, he would eat forkfuls of the fruit, then down the drink. It was\u2014and is\u2014the perfect prelude to dessert.","799":"This recipe originally accompanied Smoked Turkey and Bacon Chowder .","800":"The combination of melon, marjoram, and sweet moscato vinegar in this delicate salad tastes like summer to me. When I serve guests this dish, I like to watch them take their first bite and enjoy a moment of pure bliss as the melon juices run down their chin.","801":"If you pour the bubbly too quickly, the drink will foam up and over the edge of the glass.","802":"With different girls","803":"You can use this simple formula to wake up the Beer-Can Chicken , add another layer of flavor to the Barbecued Chicken , or sass up plenty of things that aren't poultry, like pork, steak, or vegetables.","804":"Adding watercress to potato salad gives this old standby new life. We particularly like the contrast of the crisp, peppery green against the warm, vinegar- and mustard-spiced potatoes.","805":"I love visiting Buddhist temples in Asia, not for religious reasons but because I enjoy the food served in their restaurants. This recipe was inspired by the fried vegetarian spring rolls I ate at the Shaolin Temple.","806":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","807":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.","808":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","809":"The key to cooking with chiles is to think of their heat not as a dare but as another essential building block of flavor, right alongside salt, acid, and fat. Rather than overpowering a dish, a perfectly calibrated prickle of spice enhances the other elements and wakes up the palate.","810":"The following is a slightly-NSFW recipe from the brilliant minds behind the popular cooking blog Thug Kitchen. To learn more about them, read our profile.\u2014Epicurious Editors","811":"Use butternut squash or a small, firm cooking pumpkin such as a sugar pumpkin for the best results.","812":"The color yellow symbolized joy for medieval Arabs, who were cultivating saffron in Spain by 960 c.e. Sephardic Jews were equally inspired by the coveted spice, and golden rice became a holiday and Sabbath tradition. This version, made with basmati rice, is punctuated by caramelized onion, currants, and fried almonds.","813":"Escoffier codified the mother sauces of French cooking. In the Italian-American tradition, there is only one: tomato sauce. Call it marinara (we do), call it gravy (we don't), call it whatever your grandma called it. It's tomato sauce. There's almost nothing we won't cook in it or put it on.","814":"This thick and comforting dish is delicious sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.","815":"This simple salad is designed to highlight the delightful spotted cargamanto beans. You can use either the red or white variety; both lose their mottled colors when cooked. Because these beans are so meaty, we use a dressing inspired by chimichurri, the Argentinean sauce for grilled meats.","816":"Green chiles pickled in soy sauce and vinegar are a traditional Korean banchan, so food editor Lillian Chou, who created this menu, was surprised when she discovered a similar dish made with jalape\u00f1os and soy sauce at a taco bar in Mexico. But it's no wonder the combination has universal appeal. Here, Chou calls for brown sugar and lemon zest in place of vinegar, and the ingredients hit all the right spots: hot, salty, and a little sweet. Chile fanatics will be happy to munch on these just as they are, but the jalape\u00f1os and their liquid also make a terrific accompaniment to the first course of <epi:recieplink id=\"3510910\">shrimp and scallion pancakes.<\/epi:recieplink>","817":"Skillet-toasting quinoa will add texture and flavor to a dish. I recommend using a nonstick skillet for this. If you use a standard skillet, the quinoa requires more attention and the skillet needs occasional scraping. The goal is for the quinoa to retain its tenderness but acquire a toasted exterior. You can cook the quinoa more or less, according to your taste preferences.","818":"When the nights turn blustery and the temperature drops, I know that roasted vegetable season has arrived, and I embrace it with reckless abandon. I'll roast any kind of sturdy vegetable that I can cut up and fit into my oven, but one of my favorites is cauliflower, preferably tossed with whole cumin seeds. Not only does the cumin act as a natural remedy to help reduce the dreaded intestinal gas factor (or so I've been told), but it also adds a pleasant earthy flavor to balance the assertive tang of the vegetable.","819":"Soundtrack: \"Sankofa\" by Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and Tony Allen from Allen Chop Up and \"Sankofa\" by Cassandra Wilson from Blue Light 'Til Dawn","820":"I love the taste and color of sweet potatoes and yams. They are packed with vitamins and minerals and are delicious to boot! This bread is sweet enough for dessert and savory enough for dinner.","821":"This recipe originally accompanied Goat Cheese Souffl\u00e9 and Mixed Greens with Raspberry Vinaigrette .","822":"In this recipe-for a change of pace from plain olive oil-try any of the oils currently on the market that are flavored with garlic, basil, or rosemary.","823":"Make this Turkish-inspired side dish into a light summer main course by adding grilled shrimp or chicken or by simply sprinkling with goat cheese. What to drink: Assyrtiko (a white varietal from Greece), Pinot Grigio, or Sauvignon Blanc.","824":"How to choose corn: Look for tight, squeaky, green husks and rows of kernels that feel taut and full when you run your hands over the cobs.","825":"This drink was featured as a Cocktail of the Month. Adapted from the original, our recipe spares you some unpleasant puckering, because we've scaled back the lime juice. Click here to learn more about the Mike Romanoff.","826":"Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 40 min","827":"Ensalada de Ejote, Espinaca, y Betabel","828":"Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 2 1\/2 hr","829":"Sean Traynor, bartender at The Windsor in Phoenix, Arizona, created this crisp, beautifully hued cocktail for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. Sparkling wine is often used to top off a drink, but in this case Traynor mixes it with the rest of the ingredients in the cocktail shaker. The reason? He's using it more for its acidity and flavor than effervescence. For pure peach flavor, Traynor insists on a true peach-based liqueur, so put away the peach Schnapps; he recommends Sathenay Cr\u00e8me de P\u00eache de Vigne Liqueur, Rothman & Winter Orchard Peach Liqueur, or Massenez Cr\u00e8me de P\u00eache.","830":"Who knew Cabernet and cranberries would make such a dynamic duo? Add dried figs (plumped in the Cabernet ahead of time), and you end up with a winey, fruity fig bar, minus the cookie. This sauce is so fine, you'll be spooning leftovers on ice cream or slathering it on toast in place of jam. It's worth buying extra cranberries and freezing them so you can make more to last you through the winter.","831":"Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 35 min","832":"If you are the cook around the house, you know how sweet the words \"I love this. Please make it again!\" sound. This side has become my go-to dish for something quick and pretty, as I love the juxtaposition of the two shades of green. After you remove the leaves from the brussels sprouts, this takes only minutes to prepare. Brussels sprouts are miniature balls of cabbage, so their stems can be pretty tough. By working from the outermost leaf inward, and cutting more of the stem whenever necessary, you follow the pattern of the sprout to easily remove its leaves. You can do this part in advance, but you'll want to saut\u00e9 them just before serving.","833":"Because this dish was developed to complement the strong flavors of Pork Loin with Morel Stuffing, we kept the seasoning in these vegetables to a minimum. If you plan to serve this dish with simpler fare, you might want to increase the amount of garlic and herbs.","834":"It's impossible to overstate just how well the ingredients come together in this beautiful salad. The textural contrast of juicy ripe oranges and crisp endives is enhanced by a surprisingly complex vinaigrette containing sweet, spicy, and smoky flavors.","835":"\"This is one of my favorite pastas,\" Lisa Bonacossi said, citing its simplicity. \"it is made with lemons, pine nuts, and oil that everyone has on hand.\" The flavors are simple and brilliant. The sauce is best served with fresh tagliatelle. I serve it with lemon wedges too for those who like to squeeze a bit of fresh juice over the pasta. Serve this with a well-chilled Pinot Grigio for a nice, bright combination.","836":"(Salade Verte \u00e0 la Vinaigrette)","837":"This sauce goes with almost any topping. Three to try: slices of fresh mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, and roasted eggplant. This recipe originally accompanied the <epi:recipelink id=\"352109\">Overnight Pizza Dough recipe<\/epi:recipelink>","838":"While bean fritters are thought to have their origin in Nigeria, one can find them throughout West Africa. Inspired by the black-eyed pea fritters served at the Gambian-Cameroonian restaurant Bennachin in New Orleans, I whipped up this dish.","839":"Cooking cruciferous vegetables without boiling them, as in this recipe, seems to make them more fragrant and heady\u2014just the way the robust Romans like their food.","840":"This recipe is an accompaniment for Cheddar Shortcakes with Corned Beef Hash.","841":"Tired of potatoes? Try parsnips.","842":"Erisheris are thick curries traditionally made with yams or pumpkin, toasted coconut, and whole kidney beans. They are hearty and earthy, with a tropical twist of coconut and curry leaves. My variation, made with sweet potatoes, crosses over beautifully to a fall or winter menu; I've even served it for Thanksgiving. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.","843":"These vegan brownies took at least thirty rounds of serious test-kitchen madness (not kidding!). When we finally said, okay, okay, moist and crumbly and chocolatey and delicious, we gave in. I used flaxseed meal and warm water to create a binder that replaces the need for egg. These egg-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, guilt-free brownies are some of the best you will ever taste! They will crumble a bit more than regular brownies, so beware of crumbs!","844":"You can stuff this slawlike salad inside your pita, or eat it on its own.","845":"There is no USDA data for water bath canning artichokes. I developed this recipe, which has a pH of 3.5, well within the safety limits for water bath canning. The processing time is based on the recommended time for marinated peppers, which contain similar quantities of olive oil\u2014an important consideration when water bath processing foods.","846":"Spicy Sichuan pepper, which delivers a numbing effect along with nuanced heat, will leave your lips buzzing. Use any leftover chili oil in dressings or marinades.","847":"\"The Indians and English use them much,\" wrote one visitor to New England in 1663, \"boyling them with Sugar for Sauce to eat with their Meat, and it is a delicate Sauce.\" Although there is little evidence that cranberry sauce was served at the first Thanksgiving, it is assumed that Indians brought it to the feast. This tangy version gets its intense flavor and color from a mixture of fresh and dried cranberries, along with frozen cranberry juice cocktail concentrate.","848":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","849":"Refreshing and a little bit inebriating; if you've got kids running around, pick up a box of Rocket Pops so there's no confusion!","850":"A rich meal calls for a crisp salad, in shades of green and white, to cleanse your palate. Radish sprouts add a peppery bite to the crunchy jicama and flat leaves of parsley and celery.","851":"You need a palate-cleansing salad to balance the rich pork and hearty sides: This is it.","852":"You can pluck the herbs ahead of time and chill them wrapped in damp paper towels in airtight bags.","853":"Sweetened by pepper and rounded out with cilantro, vinegar, and tomato paste, this Latin American staple is perfect with anything on your table or as a meal itself.","854":"Fresh cranberries make a tangy, slightly tannic, and very refreshing sorbet. Infused with the fruity aroma of orange, lemon, or English thyme, the sorbet is a delightfully unique cranberry dish to serve before, during, or after Thanksgiving dinner.","855":"Roasting a whole head of cauliflower at high heat creates beautifully caramelized florets. It's perfectly offset by fresh parsley and a drizzle of a quick lemon dressing.","856":"Criolla is traditionally served as a sauce for grilled meats, but we tossed it with bell peppers as an accompaniment or side dish. If you're making this with the Spinach and Carrot Stuffed Flank Steak, grill the bell peppers before you start cooking the steak.","857":"Try this for breakfast with a side of yogurt or for dessert with gingersnap cookies.","858":"A salad of oranges and slightly bitter endive and escarole rounds out the buffet of fried latkes and rich toppings.","859":"Moroccan hospitality, always gracious, begins with mezes, the enticing little dishes set out to welcome guests before the meal. Cumin and mint are a classic combination, and they work particularly well with roasted beets \u2014 the cumin underlines their earthiness, and the mint freshens their undeniable sweetness.","860":"The levels of sweet and sour in caponata vary from household to household. In this version, the onions and celery are caramelized for incredible depth of flavor\u2014which improves over time.","861":"This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","862":"A traditional highball drink that's very low in sugar, it's also incredibly popular at soda fountains sans alcohol. The lime and bitters are a great pairing with the naturally sweet coconut water.","863":"If desired, the smoothie can be strained to remove the berry seeds, but the seeds contain lots of beneficial dietary fiber.","864":"Gremolata is the classic osso buco garnish of minced lemon peel, garlic, and parsley. In this version, lemon peel and shallots perfume a simple breadcrumb topping.","865":"We recommend using a good-quality California or Spanish sparkling wine for this punch. Both are widely available and less expensive than Champagne.","866":"This recipe is from chef Peter Doyle from Cicada in Sydney. \"This dish is a play on Maltaise sauce, but in a lighter, fresher version more conducive to our climate.\"","867":"Boiling down the cider gives great apple flavor; parsley adds color and freshness.","868":"Grilled and then tossed with a simple mustard vinaigrette, these vegetables turn tender and juicy, providing an ideal foil for the hearty grilled steaks.","869":"Don't obsess over getting these exact ingredients in this precise combination. Any nut you like will work here for crunch, and you're looking for a mix of bright herbs and enough cooked grains to make it substantial.","870":"I love many versions of baked stuffed tomatoes, but the simple recipe of Torquato Innocenti, who sells tomatoes in Florence's Piazza Santo Spirito market, is my favorite. Nothing more than garlic, basil or parsley, and \"good oil\" fills the tomatoes.","871":"Picada is a Spanish flavoring made with garlic, herbs, and ground nuts. Here, breadcrumbs stand in for the nuts.","872":"This rich guacamole is the ideal skinny dip. Creamy avocado isn't just velvety- smooth on the tongue\u2014it also helps to keep your skin soft and supple thanks to its pro-vitamin A compounds, which are thought to help prevent wrinkles.","873":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","874":"It's easy to transform the leftover rice from our Chinese Black Rice recipe into this beautiful and satisfying salad\u2014just add crunchy celery, radishes, and a fresh basil dressing. In supermarkets, black rice (often labeled \"Forbidden Rice\") is usually found in 15\u2013ounce packages; Asian markets often sell it in larger quantities.","875":"Why use frozen berries in the summer, when local fruit is at its peak? Because we love fresh local berries so much when whole or, in the case of strawberries, when sliced as well, pur\u00e9eing them seems almost a sacrilege. If, however, you've got a surplus of fresh berries, go ahead and pur\u00e9e them.","876":"The dressing can also be used for Chinese chicken salad or as a basting sauce for grilled steaks or chops. Look for rice vinegar in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.","877":"A great accompaniment to baked fish or sausage calzones.","878":"The heat in fresh poblano chiles varies considerably; you may want to use more than one in this dish if they are not too hot. The saut\u00e9ed vegetables can sit at room temperature for several hours before serving.","879":"Beer-Can Chicken, step aside. Cabbage becomes the star of any backyard barbecue with this awesome beer-steaming\u2013plus\u2013grilling technique. Slathering the cabbage with barbecue sauce during cooking gives it a smoky, sweet flavor. Top with rich cheddar cheese, fresh slaw, and spicy pickled jalape\u00f1os and you'll never miss the meat in this hearty vegetarian sandwich.","880":"A simple dessert sauce that is absolutely delicious spooned over scoops of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.","881":"Look for pomegranate juice in the juice aisle or fresh juice section of the supermarket.","882":"This salad is wonderfully refreshing even without purslane, but if you can find the green at your produce market, it's worth using for the nice crunch it adds.","883":"Sliced thin and broiled, eggplant retains a slight chewiness but still melts in the mouth; a caper and mint vinaigrette brightens everything.","884":"Broccoli slaw doesn't have to be the dried-out stuff you find pre-sliced at the grocery store. Instead, we've grated the stems and chopped the florets for a nice combo of textures. The Asian-inspired flavors in this mix can add bright tang as a side to any meal.","885":"Pan-roasting the vegetables imparts an earthy sweetness to this dish.","886":"The bright cherry flavor of kirsch gives this spiced holiday favorite a fruity kick.","887":"This recipe is part of a menu developed for Epicurious by Charles Phan, the chef-owner of San Francisco's The Slanted Door.","888":"What could be better than this racy little salad with its spicy radishes, tender m\u00e2che, and crunchy endive tossed in a cool, clear dressing? Your guests can sit back, relax, and sip their wine before diving into the sweet finale of cake and tartlets.","889":"Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Bobby Flay's Creamed Kale with Crispy Shallots .","890":"Pa-O Long Beans","891":"Cassolita","892":"Grapefruit zest stands in for lemon peel in the gremolata, an aromatic garnish.","893":"These supremely easy, wonderfully spicy potatoes are delicious with Panfried Pork Chops with Pomegranate and Fennel Salsa.","894":"Accompany this light main course with Buttery Rice Timbales.","895":"Dates are revered, and much enjoyed, in Morocco. Of the more than two hundred varieties that the country produces, large mejhoul dates are the ones used for special occasions and special recipes like these stuffed dates. Typically, the almond paste is much sweeter than in this recipe, and the stuffed date is rolled in sugar. I prefer to let the dates' natural and intense sweetness shine.","896":"I learned the joys of putting potatoes in bread during my time in the Napa Valley, so the flavors here are resonant of that magical place, but don't be afraid to change up the herbs or play with nuts and olives. You can't mess it up. Well, you can\u2014I certainly have more than once\u2014but you know what I mean. You can do this by hand, but it's messy, so I wrote this recipe with directions for using a stand mixer. \u2014Duff","897":"Sprinkle this fresh take on lemon-pepper seasoning over olive oil-rubbed chicken or steak before grilling or roasting. It's also delicious strewn over grilled or pan-roasted cod or bluefish.","898":"Asparagus or peas may be added to this recipe. Gremolata\u2014a mixture of lemon zest, garlic, and parsley typically sprinkled over osso buco (braised veal shank)\u2014is not traditionally used in Italian Jewish vegetable dishes, but it gives this one lightness and sparkle.","899":"A pretty, pale pink sorbet enhanced with a splash of Champagne.","900":"Active time: 25 min Start to finish: 2 hr","901":"Two kinds of just-cooked peas and an Asian dressing make one delicious salad.","902":"Asiago frico \u2014 easy-to-make crispy cheese wafers \u2014 top this salad. Look for tender young spinach at the farmers' market. In some areas, what you find at the farmers' market may be cheaper than what's available at the supermarket. If you have a first-rate extra-virgin olive oil and some sea salt in your cupboard, here's a chance to show them off.","903":"For this juicy, herbaceous salad, feel free to combine different varieties of cucumbers and tomatoes, which are at peak season around the same time.","904":"The all-purpose side: It goes with the lamb, the chicken, the lobster, and anything else you're grilling this summer.","905":"Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.","906":"I love using baby carrots in assorted colors. Thumbelina carrots, which are little and stubby, are great for roasting. I use red, orange, yellow, and white carrots for the ribbons, which make this salad so vibrant. Even just the orange variety next to the green of the avocado and mizuna makes a beautiful and colorful salad. Toasting whole cumin seeds and then grinding them in a mortar and pestle or an electric spice grinder is essential for the great taste of this vinaigrette.
