# Vegalicous Machine Learning Model

Creating an item-based recommendation system model using the TensorFlow library and deep learning techniques to find the best representation vectors for each item. The model will learn patterns in historical data to discover representation vectors that reflect the similarities and differences between items. Afterwards, we can utilize the Cosine Similarity measure to determine the extent to which two item representation vectors are similar to each other.
